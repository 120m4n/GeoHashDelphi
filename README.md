# Geohash Delphi

very basic (one unit) simple delphi implementation of [geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) algoritm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is a direct port of the dot Net version of the Geohash library
by 2011 (c) Sharon Lourduraj; which can be found at:

Included in this repository are a unit and a project to test . Feel comfortable modifying, reassembling and sharing the code.

It has only been tested on Delphi 10.3. But with simple changes it can be adapted to previous versions
